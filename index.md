**Welcome to the Stellenbosch University Developer Society**

We want to create a place that is exciting for people interested in computer
science and electronics, work on projects together, and build relationships that
will last past university.

The goals of the developer society are to create a community where members:
 - explore technology
 - build friendships
 - build projects
 - build relationships with people in industry.

If you have looked for a place to share things the rest of the world doesn't
find interesting (your OS, your Vim setup, a personal project, esoteric math,
etc.), or a place to hear from others who are also interested in these things -
you can be part of making a community for people like you.

__Events & Activities__: Events we host include:
* Discussions of projects we have worked on.
* Tackling projects we would like to work on together.
* Hackathons
* Quiz nights
* Talks from professors or people from industry
* Movie nights

Check out our [events](/events/) page to see what's happening when.
