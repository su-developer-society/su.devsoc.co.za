Here's the gist, I need you to compare the code in the SUDS-site app/
Add where necessary and subtract elsewhere too. I'm going to bed now because I have a commmitment tomorrow at 6am, a bit of a drag but nevertheless.


Next, I hope to do a final design review when I wake. And I may have made the rookie mistake of adding node modules. The frontend stack is Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind Css. I used a template to get started and hence whatever you see below is part of the template readme.

Finally, well. HAVE FUN?


May the six elements of Chat, Grok, Co-pilot, Claude, Gemnini and DeepSeek assist you where you get lost. 

And there's also a bunch of files you may have to remove from the repo. I trust you with this.

Peace,
ELLEN




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
